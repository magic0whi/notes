\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Definition of limits}\\
    \indent In particular, if either \(f(a)\) or \(\lim_{x\to a} f(x)\) fails to exist, then \(f\) is discontinuous at \(a\).\par
    \indent Right-hand limit: \(\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=R\), or \(f(x)\to R\text{ as }x\to a^+\).\\
    \indent Left-hand limit: \(\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=L\), or \(f(x)\to L\text{ as }x\to a^-\).\\
    \indent Overall limit: If \(\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=L\), then \(\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L\).\par
    Remember that \(x\) is approaching \(a\) but not equal \(a\).
    \begin{definition}[Formal definition of limit]
    \[
      \forall\epsilon>0,\ \exists\delta>0\text{ that if }0<\lvert x-a\rvert<\delta\text{, then }\lvert f(x)-L\rvert<\epsilon.
    \]
    That is, no matter how small \(\epsilon\) gets, we can satisfy the condition \(\lvert f(x)-L\rvert<\epsilon\) as long as \(x\) get close enough to \(a\); the proximity required is measured by \(\delta\).
    \end{definition}
  \item \textbf{Possible limit behaviors}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=\lim_{x\to a}f(x)\).
      \item \(\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)\neq\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)\).
      \item Left\slash Right-hand limit could fail to exist due to \(\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=\pm\infty\) or \(\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=\pm\infty\), because \(\infty\) is not a real number.
      \item Left\slash Right-hand limit could fail to exist because it oscillates between many values and never settle down.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The limit laws}\\
    \indent Addition: \(\lim_{x\to a}[f(x)+g(x)]=L+M\).\\
    \indent Subtraction: \(\lim_{x\to a}[f(x)-g(x)]=L-M.\)\\
    \indent Multiplication: \(\lim_{x\to a}[f(x)\cdot g(x)]=L\cdot M\).\\
    \indent Division (Part 1): If \(M\neq 0\), then \(\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{L}{M}\).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Continuity}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Definition of continuity at a point}\\
    \indent A function \(f\) is \textbf{continuous at} \(x=a\) if \(\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)\).\\
    \indent In particular, if either \(f(a)\) or \(\lim_{x\to a} f(x)\) fails to exist, then \(f\) is discontinuous at \(a\).\par
    \indent We say that a function \(f\) is \textbf{right-continuous} at \(x=a\) if \(\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=f(a)\).\\
    \indent We say that a function \(f\) is \textbf{left-continuous} at \(x=a\) if \(\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=f(a)\).
  \item \textbf{Types of discontinuities}\\
    \indent If \(\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)\) and \(\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)\) are exist but they are not equal, then we can say \(f\) has a \textbf{jump discontinuity} at \(x=a\).\\
    \indent If \(\lim_{x\to a}f(x)\) exists but does not equal \(f(a)\), then we say that \(f\) has a \textbf{removable discontinuity} at \(x=a\).
    \begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \incfig{1limit_2.2}
      \caption{Removable discontinuity}
    \end{figure}
  \item \textbf{Definition of continuous functions}\\
   \indent A function \(f(x)\) is \textbf{continuous} if for every point \(c\) in he domain of \(f(x)\), the function \(f\) is continuous at the point \(x=c\).
  \item \textbf{Basic continuous functions}\\
    \indent The following functions are continuous at \textit{all real numbers}.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item all polynomials
      \item \(\sqrt[3]{x}\) 
      \item \(\lvert x\rvert\)
      \item \(\cos x\) and \(\sin x\)
      \item exponential functions \(a^x\) with \(a>0\).
    \end{itemize}\par
    \indent The following functions are continuous \textit{at the specified values of \(x\)}.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(\sqrt{x}\), for \(x>0\).
      \item \(\tan x\), at all \(x\) where it is defined.
      \item logarithmic functions \(\log_a x\) with base \(a>0\), for \(x>0\).
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Limit laws and Continuity}\\
    \indent If the functions \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous everywhere, then:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(f\pm g\) is continuous everywhere.
      \item \(f\cdot g\) is continuous everywhere.
      \item \(\frac{f}{g}\) is continuous where it is defined.
      \item \(f\circ g\) is continuous everywhere. (``\(\circ\)'' is the composition symbol which means \(f\circ g(x)=f[g(x)]\))
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Intermediate Value Theorem}\\
    \indent If \(f\) is a function which is continuous on the interval \([a,b]\) and \(M\) lies between the values of \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\), then there is at least one point \(c\) between \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(f(c)=M\).
    \begin{note}
      A function is \textbf{continuous on a closed interval} \([a,b]\) if it is continuous on interval \((a,b)\), right-continuous at \(a\) and left-continuous at \(b\).\par
      IVT is intimately tied in with the properties of the real number system.

\section{Limits of Quotients}
If \(\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L\) and \(\lim_{x\to a}g(x)=M\), then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(M\neq 0\), then \(\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{L}{M}\)
    \item If \(M=0\) but \(L\neq 0\), then \(\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) does not exist.
    \item If both \(M=0\) and \(L=0\), then \(\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) might exist, or it might not exist. More work is necessary to determine whether the last type of limit exists and what it is if it does exist.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{The derivative}
\section{What is the Derivative?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The definition of the average rate of change.\\
        \indent The \textbf{average rate of change} of a function \(f(x)\) over an interval \(a\leq x\leq b\) is defined to be
        \[
            \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
        \]
    \item Definition of the derivative.\\
        \indent The \textbf{derivative} of a function \(f(x)\) at a point \(x=a\) is defined to be
        \[
            f^\prime(a)=\lim_{b\to a}\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
        \]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Geometric Interpretation of The Derivative}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Secant lines}\\
        \indent The \textit{secant line} of a function \(f(x)\) over the interval \(a\leq x\leq b\) is the line that passes through the points \((a,f(a))\) and \((b,f(b))\).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The slope of the secant line is \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\), which is the average rate of change of the function \(f(x)\) over the interval \(a\leq x\leq b\).
            \item The equation of the secant line is \(y=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}(x-a)+f(a)\).
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tangent lines}\\
        \indent The \textit{tangent line} to a function \(f(x)\) at the point \(x=a\) is the line that passes through the point \((a,f(a))\), and whose slope is the instantaneous rate of change of \(f(x)\) at the point \(x=a\). This slope is the slope of the line you get if you imagine zooming in on the function until it looks like a line.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The slope of the tangent line is \(f^\prime(a)\).
            \item The equation for the tangent line is \(y=f^\prime(a)(x-a)+f(a)\).
        \end{itemize}
        \noindent\textbf{Properties of tangent lines}\\
        If the derivative of \(f(x)\) exists at \(x=a\), then the tangent line exists. The tangent line may exist if the derivative is undefined at \(x=a\) though. (Example \(f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}\) has a vertical tangent line at \(x=0\).)\par
        \noindent\textbf{What a tangent line is and is not}\\
        When introduced to tangent lines of circles, many students learn that a tangent is ``a line that touches the curve in only one point. '' This is true if your curve is a circle, but for many other curves and functions, this is \textbf{not a good} definition.

            \caption{The tangent line passes through multiple times of the function}
        \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Derivative as A Function}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Recall secant and tangent lines}\\
        \indent In calculus, we often think of the function and its graph as being the same object. So to study functions, we often study their graphs.\par
        Recall: the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph through that point. But when our graph is nice and smooth, without any discontinuities, corners, or other weird behavior, we can find the slope of the tangent line at any point. Thus we can think of the derivative of a function as a function.
    \item \textbf{Example: The graph of a function and its derivative}
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \incfig{2derivative_3.1}
            \caption{The graph of a function \(y=g(x)\)}
        \end{figure}
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \incfig{2derivative_3.2}
            \caption{The graph of the derivative \(y=g^\prime(x)\)}
        \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Calculating Derivatives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Derivatives of constant multiples}\\
        \indent If \(g(x)=kf(x)\) for some constant \(k\), then
        \[
            g^\prime(x)=kf^\prime(x)
        \]
        at all points where \(f\) is differentiable.
        \begin{proof}
            Suppose that \(g(x)=kf(x)\) for all \(x\), where \(k\) is a constant. We want to prove that \(g^\prime(x)=kf^\prime(x)\) at any point \(x\) where \(f\) is differentiable.\par
        We know that
        \begin{align*}
            g^\prime(x) & =\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{g(x+\Delta x)-g(x)}{\Delta x}\\
                        & =\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{kf(x+\Delta x)-kf(x)}{\Delta x}\\
                        & =\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}k\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}\\
                        & =\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}k\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}
        \end{align*}
        The first limit is just \(k\), and the second limit is the definition of \(f^\prime(x)\). So we get \(g^\prime=kf^\prime(x)\).
        \end{proof}
    \item \textbf{Derivatives of sums}\\
        \indent If \(h(x)=f(x)+g(x)\), then
        \[
            h^\prime(x)=f^\prime(x)+g^\prime(x)
        \]
        at all points where \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable.
    \item \textbf{Derivatives of differences}\\
        \indent Similarly, if \(j(x)=f(x)-g(x)\), then
        \[
            j^\prime(x)=f^\prime(x)+g^\prime(x)
        \]
        at all points where \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable.
    \item \textbf{What is linearity?}\\
        \indent We've seen that differentiation ``respects'' addition and multiplication by a constant. That is, if you take a derivative of a sum of functions, you get the same thing as if you differentiated each part, and then added the derivatives. Similarly, if you take the derivative of \(k\) times a function, where \(k\) is a constant, then you get \(k\) times the derivative of the original function.\par
        Respecting addition and constant multiplication in this way is called ``linearity'', and it is an important property of the derivative operation!
    \item \textbf{The Power Rule}\\
        \indent If \(n\) is any fixed number, and \(f(x)=x^n\), then \(f^\prime(x)=nx^{n-1}\).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Leibniz notation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Why do we use Leibniz notation?}\\
        \indent The biggest reason is that it reminds us what the input variable is. The derivative is measuring the instantaneous rate of change of the output variable of a function with respect to the input variable. Sometimes, if there are lots of quantities that have variables representing them, it's easy to lose track of what is what; Leibniz notation helps to remind us.
    \item \textbf{Properties of Leibniz notation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Units}: If \(P\) has units of pressure, and \(t\) has units of \textit{time}, then \(\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}t}\) has units of pressure per time.
            \item \textbf{Evaluating at point}: If we want to take the derivative at a particular point \(x=3\), then we use the notation \(\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x}\right|_{x=3}\). The bar is read as ``evaluated at''.
            \item \textbf{Derivatives act on functions}\\
                \indent We can write \(\frac{\mathrm{d}(x^2)}{\mathrm{d}x}\) for the derivative of \(x^2\).\par
                If a formula is long, we can write \(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}y}(y^3+2y^2)\).
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Second Derivatives and Higher}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Second derivative}\\
        \indent The second derivative of a function \(f(x)\) is the first derivative of \(f^\prime(x)\), and is denoted by \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\) or \(\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 f}{\mathrm{d}x^2}\).
        \begin{proof}
            The second derivative in Leibniz notation is written by this transform
            \[
                f^{\prime\prime}(x)
                =\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(f)\right)
                =\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)^2(f)
                =\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 f}{\mathrm{d}x^2}
            \]
        \end{proof}
    \item \textbf{Higher derivatives}\\
        \indent The \(n\)th derivative of a function \(f(x)\) is the first derivative of \(f^{(n-1)}(x)\), and is denoted by \(f^{(n)}(x)\) or \(\frac{\mathrm{d}^n f}{\mathrm{d} x^n}\).
    \item \textbf{Second derivative and concavity summary}\\
        \indent On intervals where \(f^{\prime\prime}>0\), the function \(f\) is concave up.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \incfig{2derivative_6.1}
        \end{figure}
        On intervals where \(f^{\prime\prime}<0\), the function \(f\) is concave down.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \incfig{2derivative_6.2}
        \end{figure}
        Points where the graph of a function changes from concave up to concave down, or vice versa, are called \textbf{inflection points}.
    \item \textbf{Position, velocity, acceleration}\\
        \indent If \(x(t)\) is a function that describes position as a function of time, then \(x^\prime(t)\) is the velocity, and \(x^{\prime\prime} (t)\) is the acceleration.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Trigonometric Functions: Sine and Cosine}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Definition of significant figures}\\
        \indent The number of \textit{significant figures} is the count of those digits that carry meaning with regards to precision.\par
        \begin{eg}\leavevmode
            \begin{itemize}
                \item All non-zero digits are significant: 1235 has 4 significant digits.
                \item Zeros appearing between nonzero digits are significant: 101 has 3 significant digits.
                \item Trailing zeros in a number containing a decimal are significant: 32.000 has 5 significant figures.
            \end{itemize}
            \textsf{\textbf{\color{NavyBlue!70!Black}Non-examples.}}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Trailing zeros in a number with no decimal are \textit{not} significant: 5400 has 2 significant figures.
                \item Leading zeros in decimal number are not significant: 0.0003 has 1 significant figure.
                \item Extraneous digits introduced in a computation to greater precision than measured data are \textit{not} significant: if .25 and .50 are measurements accurate to \(\pm.01\), then in the product \((.25)(.50)=0.125\) the last 5 is \textit{not} significant.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{eg}
    \item \textbf{Derivative of sine and cosine}\\
        \indent The derivative of the trig functions are:
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\sin x= & \mathbin{\phantom{-}}\cos x\\
            \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\cos x= & -\sin x\\
            \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2}\sin x= & -\sin x\\
            \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2}\cos x= & -\cos x
        \end{align*}
        \begin{proof}
            To differentiate \(\sin x\), first we use the trig sum formula
            \begin{align*}
                \frac{\sin(x+\mathrm{d}x)-\sin x}{\mathrm{d}x} & =\frac{\sin x\cos\mathrm{d}x+\cos x\sin\mathrm{d}x-\sin x}{\mathrm{d}x} & \\
                                                                & =\sin x\left(\frac{\cos\mathrm{d}x-1}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)+\cos x\left(\frac{\sin\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)\\
                                                                & =\sin x\cos0^\prime+\cos x\sin0^\prime
            \end{align*}
            To proof \(\cos0^\prime=0\) and \(\sin0^\prime=1\) using geometry, first we draw a unit circle. For convenience, replace \(x\) with \(\theta\).
            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \incfig{2derivative_7.1}
                \caption{Unit circle with angle \(\theta\) (Radian)}
            \end{figure}
            Then zoom in and make angle \(\theta\) smaller, we found
            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \incfig{2derivative_7.2}
                \caption{Zoomed in \(\theta\) (Radian)}
            \end{figure}
            while \(\theta\to0\), \(1-\cos\theta\) getting smaller \textbf{faster} than \(\theta\) itself, and \(\sin\theta\) approaching the arc \(\theta\). Therefore \(\frac{\cos\mathrm{d}\theta-1}{\mathrm{d}\theta}=0\), \(\frac{\sin\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}\theta}=1\). Which is \(\cos0^\prime=0\) and \(\sin0^\prime=1\).\\
            \indent To summarize, \(\sin^\prime x=\sin x\cos^\prime 0+\cos x\sin^\prime 0=\sin x\cdot0+\cos x\cdot1=\cos x\).\par
            So as to cosine, differentiate \(\cos x\) we get \(\cos^\prime x=\cos x\left(\frac{\cos\mathrm{d}x-1}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)-\sin x\left(\frac{\sin\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)=\cos x\cos^\prime 0-\sin x\sin^\prime 0=-\sin x\)
        \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
