\section{Graphing and Critical Points: 1st and 2nd Derivative Tests}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item\textbf{The First Derivative Test - Finding Local Maxima and Minima}\\
    \indent Suppose the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x=a\) and has a critical point at \(x=a\).
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(f\) has a local minimum at \(x=a\) if \(f^\prime (x)<0\) just to the left of \(a\) and \(f^\prime (x)>0\) just to the right of \(a\).
        \begin{figure}[H]

          \incfig{4applications_1.1}
          \caption{local minimum}
        \end{figure}
      \item \(f\) has a local maximum at \(x=a\) if \(f^\prime (x)>0\) just to the left of \(a\) and \(f^\prime (x)>0\) just to the right of \(a\).
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \incfig{4applications_1.2}
          \caption{local maximum}
        \end{figure}
      \item The point \(x=a\) is neither a local minimum nor a local maximum of \(f\) if \(f^\prime (x)\) has the same sign just to the left of \(a\) and just to the right of \(a\).
      \end{itemize}
      \begin{note}[Just to the left or right]
        When we use the phrase ``\(f^\prime (x)>0\) just to the left of \(a\)'', we mean that there is some open interval \((a-c,a)\) of positive width \(c\) on which \(f^\prime\) is positive. This interval does not have to be very big, as long as it has some size.\par
        Similarly, ``\(f^\prime (x)>0\)'' just to the right of \(a\)'' means that there is some open interval \((a,a+d)\) of positive width \(d\) on which \(f^\prime\) is positive.
      \end{note}
  \item\textbf{The Second Derivative Test}\\
    \indent Suppose that \(x=a\) is a critical point of \(f\), with \(f^\prime (a)=0\).
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If \(f^{\prime\prime}(a)>0\), then \(f\) has a local minimum at \(x=a\).
      \item If \(f^{\prime\prime}(a)<0\), then \(f\) has a local maximum at \(x=a\).
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \incfig{4applications_1.3}
          \caption{Second Derivative Test}
        \end{figure}
      \item If \(f^{\prime\prime}(a)=0\) or does not exist, then the test is inconclusive \textemdash\ there might be a local minimum, or a local maximum, or neither.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{note}
      In cases where the first derivative test is in conclusive, we can try the third derivative to determine whether critical point is a local minimum or maximum. But in most cases use interval sampling is less efforts.
