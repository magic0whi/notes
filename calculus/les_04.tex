\section{Graphing and Critical Points: 1st and 2nd Derivative Tests}
\subsection{The First Derivative Test\textemdash Finding Local Maxima and Minima}
Suppose the function $f$ is continuous at $x=a$ and has a critical point at $x=a$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ has a local minimum at $x=a$ if $f^\prime(x)<0$ just to the left of $a$ and $f^\prime(x)>0$ just to the right of $a$.
  \begin{figure}[H]

    \incfig{4applications_1.1}
    \caption{local minimum}
  \end{figure}
\item $f$ has a local maximum at $x=a$ if $f^\prime (x)>0$ just to the left of $a$ and $f^\prime (x)>0$ just to the right of $a$.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \incfig{4applications_1.2}
    \caption{local maximum}
  \end{figure}
\item The point $x=a$ is neither a local minimum nor a local maximum of $f$ if $f^\prime (x)$ has the same sign just to the left and right of $a$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Second Derivative Test}
Suppose that $x=a$ is a critical point of $f$, with $f^\prime(a)=0$.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $f^{\prime\prime}(a)>0$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $x=a$.
\item If $f^{\prime\prime}(a)<0$, then $f$ has a local maximum at $x=a$.
\item If $f^{\prime\prime}(a)=0$ or does not exist, then the test is inconclusive\textemdash there might be a local minimum, or a local maximum, or neither.
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Critical points]
Critical points are where $f^\prime=0$ or where $f$ is not differentiable.
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
  In cases where the first derivative test is inconclusive, we can try the third derivative to determine whether critical point is a local minimum or maximum. But in most cases use interval sampling of first derivative is less efforts.

\section{The Big Picture: Limits and Asymptotics}
\subsection{Curve Sketching}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Plot
  \begin{itemize}
  \item discontinuities;
  \item end points ($x\to\pm\infty$);
  \item easy points ($x=0$ or $y=0$).
  \end{itemize}
\item Plot critical points and values (Try solve $f^\prime=0$).
\item Decide whether $f^\prime<0$ or $f^\prime>0$ on each interval between discontinuities, end points, and critical points.
\item Identify where $f^{\prime\prime}<0$ (Concave down) and $f^{\prime\prime}>0$ (Concave up). Identify inflection points.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{L'H\^opital's Rule}
\begin{itemize}
\item (Version 1) Indeterminate form $0/0$\\
  If functions $f(x)\to0$, $g(x)\to0$ as $x\to a$, and $f$, $g$ are differentiable near the point $x=a$, then limit
  \[\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f^\prime(x)}{g^\prime(x)}\]
  provided that the right hand limit exists or is $\pm\infty$.
\item (Version 2) Indeterminate form $\infty/\infty$\\
  If functions $f(x)\to\infty$, $g(x)\to\infty$ as $x\to a$, and $f$, $g$ are differentiable near the point $x=a$, then limit
  \[\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f^\prime(x)}{g^\prime(x)}\]
  provided that the right hand limit exists or is $\pm\infty$.
\item Other indeterminate forms $0\cdot\infty$, $\infty-\infty$, $0^0$, $1^\infty$ and $\infty^0$ should be rearranged to be of the form $0/0$ or $\infty/\infty$ in order to apply L'H\^opital's rule (By using differentiation metholds like change base to $e$).
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
  \begin{itemize}\leavevmode
  \item We can replace $a$ with $\pm\infty$; or $a^+$, $a^-$ and the results still hold.
  \item It's worth to look again before L'Hop. Apply L'Hop to non-indeterminate form is probably got a wrong result.
  \end{itemize}
